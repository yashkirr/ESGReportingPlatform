# How to Contribute to this Project
This is a beginner-friendly guide on how to create a pull request and add your name to the README file.

## What is a pull request?

A pull request is a way to suggest changes to a project on GitHub. When you create a pull request, you are proposing changes to the original codebase. The project maintainers can review your changes and decide whether or not to merge them into the main codebase.

## How to create a pull request

1. Fork the repository - To create a pull request, you first need to fork the repository. This will create a copy of the project in your GitHub account that you can modify.

2. Clone the forked repository - After forking, clone the forked repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git```

3. Create a new branch - Before making any changes, create a new branch. This will help you keep your changes separate from the main branch. You can create a new branch by running the following command:

```git checkout -b <new-branch-name>```

4. Make changes - Now you can make changes to the code. In this case, you want to add your name to the README file. Open the README file in a text editor and add your name to the list.

6. Push changes to GitHub - After committing your changes, you need to push them to your forked repository. You can do this by running the following command:

```git push origin <branch-name>```

7. Create a pull request - Finally, you can create a pull request by navigating to your forked repository on GitHub and clicking the "New pull request" button. Select the branch you just created and click "Create pull request". Add a title and description for your pull request, and then click "Create pull request" again.
